How to make PCB at home?
1.	Get the print done on glossy 150 gsm paper. Avoid magazine papers.
a.	Use laser toner with at least 600 dpi resolution
b.	Use darkest mode of printer, disable toner save option.
2.	Clean the pcb with steel wool or scotch brite with pril or vim bar. It should be shiny enough with no obstructions or patch. Clean and dry it with kitchen paper towel.
3.	Make sure not to touch either the copper side or the paper with print with finger/thumb.
4.	Heat the iron up to 120c, Put the thermostat switch to 75% of max setting for synthetic temp setting.
5.	Heat the pcb with iron with copper side up. Once the pcb is hot put the printer paper with print facing on the pcb copper. It should immediately stick to the pcb copper.
6.	Put a kitchen towel on the paper so that once you press with iron the pressure is uniformly distributed.
7.	Now press with the hot iron. Take a timer and set the alarm for 2 minutes at least. Press hard on the iron until the alarm goes off. Press very hard with your entire body weight and don’t release the pressure until the alarm rings. If you think the pressure with less on some parts, then do the ironing for another 2 minutes on those parts. Don’t move the iron as you do during normal ironing.
8.	Let it be cool. Don’t tamper with it. Once cool, put it under sink water flow and wait until it is totally soaked. You will be able to understand once it is properly soaked. Don’t rush. Give it enough time. Then slowly rub off the paper and you will see most of the toner is now transferred to pcb.
9.	If some broken lines are there, don’t worry! Take any permanent marker that is water resistant and cover up the broken lines. 
Note: To check if the pen is good take a small piece of copper board and draw some thick lines on the board. Put the board in the etchant solution and see if the pen ink wears off. If it stays you can safely use it.
10.	Now prepare the etching solution.
a.	Take 1 portion of 3% H2O2, and 1 portion of Muriatic acid, use the acid sold for bathroom cleaning out of the box without adding any water to dilute. 
b.	If you have H2O2 with different concentration add appropriate portion of water to make it 3% strength. For example, if you have 6% H2O2, take 10ml of water, add 10 ml of H2O2 to it. Note: Never add water to H2O2. Now this entire 20 ml solution is 3% H2O2. 
c.	Now take 20 ml of HCL (Muriatic acid) in a plastic container, and Add that 20 ml of 3% H2O2 solution to it. The solution should go from golden to white. 
d.	In that white solution put the copper board you prepared in step 9.
11.	Wait and watch. From the edge of the board the copper should go off slowly in front of your eyes, and the solution would turn green. Don’t go too close to the solution, it exerts chlorine fumes which is toxic. Also, the container would get hot and it is an exothermic reaction.
Note: If you don’t see any copper going off after 5 minutes, the problem may be old H2O2, which is no more active. Check it by putting it on your wound. It should bubble if it is active. If you don’t get new peroxide bottle at this very moment try adding some more peroxide to the solution. If still nothing happens get sealed bottle of peroxide.
12.	You can preserve the green solution in an airtight container for future use. Add some peroxide for every subsequent use. The solution should be white while you add a new board to it.
13.	Get some acetone or thinner or nail polish remover to clean up the board and remove the black toner from it. Your board is ready to be drilled.
